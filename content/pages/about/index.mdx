### Hi!

I'm Vishal Reddy Mandadi, a junior at IIIT-Hyderabad, currently persuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently an undergrad researcher at Robotics Research Center, IIIT-H, working on Rearrangement Planning under the guidance of Dr. K. Madhava Krishna. 

Some of my core research interests include: Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Intelligent Games and Game theory. In general, I am also interested in sciences (physics and evolutionary biology) and math (game theory and calculus).


### Hobbies and general
I spend huge amount of my free time playing football at home alone (the new "pandemic" normal) improving on my agility and dribbling skills.
Apart from that, whenever I find time, I watch movies generally from dark, horror (non-supernatural), thriller and action genres. You can take a look at my movie suggestions [here](#). I watch football regularly and 
follow FC Barcelona. 

Some of the most unforgettable match nights include: Arg 0:1 Ger (2014) (pain), Arg 3:4 Fra (2018) (pain), FCB 6:1 PSG (2017) (pleasure!)
