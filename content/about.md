Hey there!

Welcome to my little blog corner! Here, I dive into all things technical. Get ready for some mind-blowing stuff on Reinforcement Learning for the next few months. I'll be spilling the beans on policy gradients and the cutting-edge research going on in this field. Oh, and don't be surprised if I occasionally wander into the realms of economics or neuroscience. My brain can't resist the temptation of exploring diverse topicsâ€”it takes "unity in diversity" to a whole new level! So stick around and let's have some fun together :fire:.



Yup, I watch animes occasionally :eyes:.
